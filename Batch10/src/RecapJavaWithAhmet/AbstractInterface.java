    //Possible interview question:
    // What is the difference between Abstract and Interface
    // When you see grey text it's means it is unnesessary code

    //Once you use implement you have to implement the methods
    //Extend for one Parent, implement you can use multiply implements
    // Abstract class is declared with Abstract keyword
    // It can have abstact  nad non abstract methods
    //For abstract we use extend key word
    // We cannot create an object from abstract class
    //We can only extend 1 parent

    //Interface
    // Interface class is declared with Interface keyword
    // We use implement key word
    //We cannot create an object from interface class
    // It can have abstract methods, default methods, static methods
    // We can implemet as many as parents we want (extend can also come before implements,
    // but only one time( extend can also come before implement but only 1 extend key word
