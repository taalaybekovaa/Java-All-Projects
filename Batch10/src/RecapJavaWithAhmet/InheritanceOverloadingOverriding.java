    // What is the inheritance? Inheritance is the way of making connection between classes
    // Overloading and overriding: they are useful to my project or my class.
   // Overloading and overriding are very useful for the classes. Overloading  example:
    //Overloading must have different method signature
    // Different method signature means same name but different parameters
    // Overloading must be in same class
    // Overloading methods can have static and final keyword

    //Overriding
    // Overload must have same method signature
    //(same name with same parameters)
    // Overriding must be in different class.
    // Overriding methods can not have static and final class
