    //Garbage collector is the way of cleaning unused data in the class. It comes from SYstem.
    //System.gc();
    //You need to override the finalize method from the object to see that gc is working
    //2) You can  delete the object by assigning NULL value
    //int a =5;  int b=6; int c=7; a=b;
    // at this time 5 will be garbage
    //3) You can call garbage gc only one time
    //System. gc () 0--> it is automatically doing already
