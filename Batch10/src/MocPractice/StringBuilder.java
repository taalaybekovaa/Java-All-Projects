    // What is the difference between String Builder and String Buffer
    // What is the difference between String and String Builder?
    // They are similar but main different is synchronization which means in my mind first come first serve.
    // Before it moves on the next action it is completes the first one(one by one). Wait time.
    //String buffer execution is slower than String Builder because of the wait time
    // String Buffer and Hashtable are both synchronized
    //String buffer execution is slower than String builder because of this wait time.

    //2 String and String Builder :
   // String is immutable
    //String Builder is mutable
    // String and String Builder have some different
