        I want to create a head/tail game (flipping coin) with java codes;

            - get user's guess as HEAD/TAIL
            - compare user's guess with your random number 0/1 --> random.nextInt(2) <--
                - if guess is correct, print       ---> "You are lucky, it is your day today."
                - if the guess isn't correct, print  -> "Sorry, that was not the correct choice!"
            - at the end, ask user "Do you want to play again? Y/N "
                - if the answer is Y --> keep playing (this is your while condition!!!)
                - if the answer is N --> print --> "Its Ok, SEE you NEXT time!"
